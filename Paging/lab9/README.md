**Objective:** Write a program that implements the **FIFO**, **LRU** and **OPTIMAL** page replacement algorithms. First, we get a random page-reference string
where page numbers range from 0 to 9 from an input file. Apply the random page-reference string to each algorithm, and record the number of page faults incurred
by each algorithm. Implement each replacement algorithm so that the number of page frames can vary from 1 to 7. Assume that demand paging is used. 

The program should read **input.txt** from the same directory and generate **output.txt** in the same directory. The formats are shown below:
