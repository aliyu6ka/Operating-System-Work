#Task Description
Your program should be implemented in C language, run on Linux machines, and should use pthread (POSIX) library. 
Given 84 data files in CSV format (comma seperate data; each line contains a record in the dataset and a record contains multiple attributes
of the recrod seperate by comma), your tasks are the following:

1. Find the total number of unique words among all non-numeric string literals in each file
2. Find maximum, minimum, average, and variance of lengths of alphanumeric strings in each file, exclude pure numbers (either integer or floating-point values)
3. Count ratio of missing or zero values in each file. Also, find maximum, minimum, and average of the number of rows and columns of all files

#Important to Note:
The work loads are not the same for Task1, 2 and 3.
